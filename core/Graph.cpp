// Graph.cpp
// This file is intentionally minimal as the Graph class is a template class
// with its implementation in the header file (Graph.h).
//
// Template classes in C++ require their full implementation to be visible
// at the point of instantiation, which is why the implementation is in the header.
//
// This file is provided for consistency with other data structure files in the project
// and can be used for any explicit template instantiations if needed.

#include "Graph.h"

// Explicit template instantiations for common types can be added here if needed
// to reduce compile times in large projects:
//
// template class Graph<int>;
// template class Graph<std::string>;
// template class Graph<double>;
